3.x) (The project is renamed from angular2-echarts)\n\nOnline Demo\nOnline Docs\nStarter Project\nChangelog\n\nTable of contents\n\nngx-echarts\nTable of contents\n\n\nGetting Started\nLatest Update\nInstallation\nUpgrade from v4.x\n\n\nUsage\nAPI\nDirective\nECharts API\nECharts Instance\nECharts Extensions\nService\n\n\nEvents\nCustom Build\nDemo\n\nGetting Started\nngx-echarts is an Angular (ver >= 2.x) directive for ECharts (ver >= 3.x).\nLatest version @npm:\n\nv5.x for Angular >= 6\nv2.3.1 for Angular https://github.com/xieziyu/ngx-echarts/blob/v2.x/README.md)\n\nA starter project on Github: https://github.com/xieziyu/ngx-echarts-starter\nLatest Update\n\n2020.08.06: v5.1.2:\n\nPR #254: Fix Angular 10 generic ModuleWithProviders depreciation (byolicooper)\n\n\n2020.08.06: v5.1.1:\n\nNPM package is broken.\n\n\n2020.07.24: v5.1.0:\n\nPR #240: Added output 'optionsError' (by trajnisz)\nPR #242: Add output for brushEnd event (by Uular)\nPR #246: Allow loading echarts library lazily via native import (by smnbbrv)\n\n\n2020.05.19: v5.0.0\n\nBREAKING CHANGES:\nNgxEchartsModule provides .forRoot() method to inject echarts core.\nDue to .forRoot method, we can do custom build without NgxEchartsCoreModule. Just import the echarts core from echarts/src/echarts, and other necessary charts.\nNgxEchartsCoreModule is removed.\n[detectEventChanges] is removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\nSince v5.0\n# if you use npm\nnpm install echarts -S\nnpm install ngx-echarts -S\n\n# or if you use yarn\nyarn add echarts\nyarn add ngx-echarts\nIf you need ECharts GL support, please install it first:\nnpm install echarts-gl -S\n\n# or\nyarn add echarts-gl\nImport other extentions such as themes or echarts-gl in your main.ts: ECharts Extensions\n\n\nUpgrade from v4.x\n\nimport echarts and provide it in NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({ echarts }).\nNgxEchartsCoreModule is removed.\n\nUsage\nPlease refer to the demo page.\n\nFirstly, import NgxEchartsModule in your app module (or any other proper angular module):\nimport { NgxEchartsModule } from 'ngx-echarts';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({\n      /**\n       * This will import all modules from echarts.\n       * If you only need custom modules,\n       * please refer to [Custom Build] section.\n       */\n      echarts: () => import('echarts'), // or import('./path-to-my-custom-echarts')\n    }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}The echarts library will be imported only when it gets called the first time thanks to the function that uses the native import.\nYou can also directly pass the echarts instead which will slow down initial rendering because it will load the whole echarts into your main bundle.\nimport { NgxEchartsModule } from 'ngx-echarts';\n\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({\n      echarts,\n    }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\nThen: use echarts directive in a div which has pre-defined height. (From v2.0, it has default height: 400px)\n\nSimple example:\n\nhtml:\n\n\nscss:\n\n.demo-chart {\n  height: 400px;\n}\ncomponent:\n\nimport { EChartOption } from 'echarts';\n\n// ...\n\nchartOption: EChartOption = {\n  xAxis: {\n    type: 'category',\n    data: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'],\n  },\n  yAxis: {\n    type: 'value',\n  },\n  series: [\n    {\n      data: [820, 932, 901, 934, 1290, 1330, 1320],\n      type: 'line',\n    },\n  ],\n};\n\n\n\nAPI\nDirective\necharts directive support following input porperties:\n\n\n\nInput\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n[options]\nobject\nnull\nIt's the same with the options in official demo site.\n\n\n[merge]\nobject\nnull\nYou can use it to update part of the options, especially helpful when you need to update the chart data. In fact, the value of merge will be used in echartsInstance.setOption() with notMerge = false. So you can refer to ECharts documentation for details\n\n\n[loading]\nboolean\nfalse\nUse it to toggle the echarts loading animation when your data is not ready.\n\n\n[autoResize]\nboolean\ntrue\nCharts will be automatically resized when container's width changed.\n\n\n[initOpts]\nobject\nnull\nThe value of [initOpts] will be used in echarts.init(). It may contain devicePixelRatio, renderer, width or height properties. Refer to ECharts documentation for details\n\n\n[theme]\nstring\nnull\nUse it to init echarts with theme. You need to import the theme file in main.ts.\n\n\n[loadingOpts]\nobject\nnull\nInput an object to customize loading style. Refer to ECharts documentation for details.\n\n\n\nBy default, loadingOpts is:\n{\n  text: 'loading',\n  color: '#c23531',\n  textColor: '#000',\n  maskColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)',\n  zlevel: 0\n}ECharts API\nIf you need echarts API such as echarts.graphic, please import it from echarts. For example:\nimport { graphic } from 'echarts';\n\nnew graphic.LinearGradient(/** ... */);ECharts Instance\nechartsInstance is exposed (since v1.1.6) in (chartInit) event. So you can directly call the APIs just like: resize(), showLoading(), etc. For example:\n\nhtml:\n\n\ncomponent:\n\nonChartInit(ec) {\n  this.echartsIntance = ec;\n}\n\nresizeChart() {\n  if (this.echartsIntance) {\n    this.echartsIntance.resize();\n  }\n}ECharts Extensions\nImport echarts theme files or other extension files after you imported echarts core. For example:\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts';\n\n/** echarts extensions: */\nimport 'echarts-gl';\nimport 'echarts/theme/macarons.js';\nimport 'echarts/dist/extension/bmap.min.js';Service\nNgxEchartsService has been obsoleted since v4.0\nEvents\nAs echarts support the 'click', 'dblclick', 'mousedown', 'mouseup', 'mouseover', 'mouseout', 'globalout' mouse events, our ngx-echarts directive also support the same mouse events but with additional chart prefix.\n\nhtml:\n\n\nThe '$event' is same with the 'params' that Echarts dispatches\n\nIt supports following event outputs:\n\n\n\n@Output\nEvent\n\n\n\n\nchartInit\nEmitted when chart is intialized\n\n\nchartClick\necharts event: 'click'\n\n\nchartDblClick\necharts event: 'dblclick'\n\n\nchartMouseDown\necharts event: 'mousedown'\n\n\nchartMouseMove\necharts event: 'mousemove'\n\n\nchartMouseUp\necharts event: 'mouseup'\n\n\nchartMouseOver\necharts event: 'mouseover'\n\n\nchartMouseOut\necharts event: 'mouseout'\n\n\nchartGlobalOut\necharts event: 'globalout'\n\n\nchartContextMenu\necharts event: 'contextmenu'\n\n\nchartLegendSelectChanged\necharts event: 'legendselectchanged'\n\n\nchartLegendSelected\necharts event: 'legendselected'\n\n\nchartLegendUnselected\necharts event: 'legendunselected'\n\n\nchartLegendScroll\necharts event: 'legendscroll'\n\n\nchartDataZoom\necharts event: 'datazoom'\n\n\nchartDataRangeSelected\necharts event: 'datarangeselected'\n\n\nchartTimelineChanged\necharts event: 'timelinechanged'\n\n\nchartTimelinePlayChanged\necharts event: 'timelineplaychanged'\n\n\nchartRestore\necharts event: 'restore'\n\n\nchartDataViewChanged\necharts event: 'dataviewchanged'\n\n\nchartMagicTypeChanged\necharts event: 'magictypechanged'\n\n\nchartPieSelectChanged\necharts event: 'pieselectchanged'\n\n\nchartPieSelected\necharts event: 'pieselected'\n\n\nchartPieUnselected\necharts event: 'pieunselected'\n\n\nchartMapSelectChanged\necharts event: 'mapselectchanged'\n\n\nchartMapSelected\necharts event: 'mapselected'\n\n\nchartMapUnselected\necharts event: 'mapunselected'\n\n\nchartAxisAreaSelected\necharts event: 'axisareaselected'\n\n\nchartFocusNodeAdjacency\necharts event: 'focusnodeadjacency'\n\n\nchartUnfocusNodeAdjacency\necharts event: 'unfocusnodeadjacency'\n\n\nchartBrush\necharts event: 'brush'\n\n\nchartBrushEnd\necharts event: 'brushend'\n\n\nchartBrushSelected\necharts event: 'brushselected'\n\n\nchartRendered\necharts event: 'rendered'\n\n\nchartFinished\necharts event: 'finished'\n\n\n\nYou can refer to the echarts tutorial: Events and Actions in ECharts for more details of the event params. You can also refer to the demo page for the detailed example.\nCustom Build\n\nPlease refer to ECharts Document for more details.\n\nIf you want to custom build echarts, prepare a file like custom-echarts.ts:\n// custom-echarts.ts\nexport * from 'echarts/src/echarts';\n\nimport 'echarts/src/chart/line';\nimport 'echarts/src/chart/bar';\n// component examples:\nimport 'echarts/src/component/tooltip';\nimport 'echarts/src/component/title';\nimport 'echarts/src/component/toolbox';And then inject it in your NgxEchartsModule:\nimport { NgxEchartsModule } from 'ngx-echarts';\nimport * as echarts from './custom-echarts';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    NgxEchartsModule.forRoot({\n      echarts,\n    }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}And if you want to use the global echarts object, please import it from lib or src instead:\nimport * as echarts from 'echarts/lib/echarts';If you need to import theme files, remember to change their 'echarts' path to 'echarts/lib/echarts', for example:\n// ... part of echarts/theme/dark.js:\nfunction (root, factory) {\n    if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n        // AMD. Register as an anonymous module.\n        define(['exports', 'echarts/lib/echarts'], factory);\n    } else if (typeof exports === 'object' && typeof exports.nodeName !== 'string') {\n        // CommonJS\n        factory(exports, require('echarts/lib/echarts'));\n    } else {\n        // Browser globals\n        factory({}, root.echarts);\n    }\n}Demo\nYou can clone this repo to your working copy and then launch the demo page in your local machine:\nnpm install\nnpm run demo\n\n# or\nyarn install\nyarn demoThe demo page server is listening to: http://localhost:4202\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017 Xie, Ziyu\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
